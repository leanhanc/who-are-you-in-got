You have the ability to read people and anticipate their every move.\nSome view you as a selfish and shameless person, but you pay no heed and continue to pursue your own agenda because you believe that man is a wolf to man.

Your family is the only thing that matters to you in this world, and you care little for the rest.\nSome say that you are spiteful, even hateful, but you pay no heed to the words of mediocre individuals, often dismissing them as plebeians.
